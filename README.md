# EmployeeManagement-SpringBoot-React
This is a simple project that I'm doing based on some courses that should test my abilities to create a Spring-Boot application

The application should facilitate the management of an employee database and present the updated database to the user in a web environment.

# Architecture : Three-Layer
The three-layer architecture is a known design pattern that helps organize the code base.

It divides the application into three distinct layers:

- Presentation Layer (Controller Layer / Web Layer)
- Service Layer (Business Logic)
- Data Access Object Layer (Persistence / Repository)


> Advantages : Promotes modularization, maintainability and scalability of the application.
